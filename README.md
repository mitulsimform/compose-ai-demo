and give power to customer by performing those action on one slash command. Where user can easily 
do math, automate some of operation like formating text, do some replace or remove word from paragraph.
```

### Assumptions

```
### Assumptions are simple, 
Thinking this business modal in the way were. code will be written to reduce time of customer 
and it will automat things based on given command. and commands will take place of all manual work
```

### Limitations

```
- Just typing won't select command automatically. Need to press enter or select using mouse click.
- while selecting using press enter it won't store values in history
```

### Milestones

```
First milestone
- Complete existing bugs
- There is one modal already implemented for custom commands. so completing that modal to give power for adding formulas as command.
- Add login/signup features so custom commands can be user specific

Second milestone (**Will prefer to create SDK parallely**)
- User can publish there methamatical commands among the platform.
- Some thirdpary app support.
- User can add thirdparty app like asana, shopify.

Third milestone
-  Create commands for third party apps. So by performing those command user can simply fetch data from thirdparty platform and send to user.

so on enhancements can be done
