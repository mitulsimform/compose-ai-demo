Start a message with / an it will show the available command to choose from the suggestion.

After typing slash commands, the existing text in textbox will be affected. Newly typed text after executing slash command will not affected.
```

### Limitations

```
User must choose a command from the options; manually entered command will not produce the expected results.

In the future, we can implement backend support to get command list, And using that we can implement many functionality Like Join group, Start meeting, Open app.
